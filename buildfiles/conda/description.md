Packages labels v3.X.X add support for dasStream version 3.0, while retaining support back to version 2.2.

In addition to supporting new stream formats, new stream utilities are provided, including:

- **das3_cdf** - Creates ISTP CDF files from das2 and das3 streams
- **das3_spice** - Adds position data and rotations to das3 streams
- **das3_csv** - Converts das2 and das3 streams to CSV streams

Older programs that start with the prefix *das2* do not handle das3 streams.

Thanks for trying das2C v3.0 :-)
