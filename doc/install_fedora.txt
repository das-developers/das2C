Instruction for installing libdas2.3 on Fedora and similar distributions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The procedure works for many RedHat compatible systems such as:

   RedHat-6, RedHat-7, CentOS-6, and CentOS-7.

For RedHat-8 and more recent Fedora distributions the commands to install
software have changed but the package names have not. 

These instructions assume you know how to find and open a terminal program on
your computer.  All text that should be typed at the command line start with
the '$' character but the leading $ character is not part of the command.


0. Setup
========
Open a terminal window and keep it open.  We're going to set some environment
variables that only exist for the terminal session in which they were set and
dissapear when the window is closed.

You won't need the terminal window after the software is installed.


1. Check compiler and source control tools
==========================================
In this step we make sure you have a compiler and source code downloader:

Run

   $ gcc --version

If you get the response "bash: gcc: command not found..."  then run:

   $ sudo yum install gcc
   
to install the gcc compiler.

Run

   $ svn --version

If you get the response "bash: svn: command not found..." then run:

   $ sudo yum install svn

to install the subversion client program.


2. Install prerequisite libraires
=================================
To install the header files and libraies needed to compile the software run
the following commands.  Pressing Y as needed.

   $ sudo yum install expat-devel
   $ sudo yum install fftw-devel
   $ sudo yum install openssl-devel


3. Download the software
========================

   $ cd 
   $ mkdir svn
   $ cd svn
   $ svn co https://saturn.physics.uiowa.edu/svn/das2/core/stable/libdas2_3
   $ cd libdas2


4. Set environment variables
============================
These instructions assume you want to install in /usr/local, which is the most
common location for custom built software.  Replace /usr/local with your
desired location below.  

Note: If not installing to /usr/local you may need to update the variables
PATH, LB_LIBRARY_PATH in your $HOME/.bashrc file.

   $ export PREFIX=/usr/local
   $ export N_ARCH=/
   
There are other environment variables you can set as well.  Look in the file
name "Makefile" to see the list.  For example you may want to have libraires
installed in /usr/local/lib64.  The varible INST_NAT_LIB could be used to
change the library install location from the default of /usr/local/lib set
above.


5. Build the library
====================
In the directory, $HOME/svn/libdas2, run the command:

  $ make

You may see a few warning messages.  Newer versions of the C compiler, GCC 
have better code analysis tools built in an have revealed a few areas where
the software could be cleaned up.  By the time you read this message the code
may build clean (i.e. no warnings) on gcc 8.


6. Test the library
===================
In the directory, $HOME/svn/libdas2, run the command:

  $ make test
  
Alot of output will scroll by.  This command runs tests the following aspects
of libdas2:

  * Convert binary data streams to text
  * Reducing stream data volume by averaging data into time bins
  * Up-converting das1 data streams
  * Computing histograms from data streams
  * General SI unit manipulations
  * Dynamic array handling
  * Federated data source catalog utilization
  * Accumplating stream values into dataset objects in memory

Some of these test call back to servers at The University of Iowa to insure 
that network operations work.  It is possible for a server at Iowa to be down,
in which case a test would fail, even though libdas2 built correctly.  In 
general all tests should pass.  If not inspect the output of "make test" to
determine the cause, or send the test output back to the developers if you
like.


7. Install the library
======================
In the directory, $HOME/svn/libdas2, run the command:

  $ sudo -E make -n install
  
and look at the locations where libdas2 files will be created.  The -E opiton
is needed or else sudo will ignore the PREFIX and N_ARCH variables you have
set.  If you are happy with these then issue:

  $ sudo -E make install
  
To make sure it's there issue:

  $ ls $PREFIX/bin/$N_ARCH
  $ ls $PREFIX/lib/$N_ARCH
  $ ls $PREFIX/include/$N_ARCH/das2

And compare to the MANIFEST section in the top level INSTALL.txt file.

To make sure the das2 programs are on your path run:

  $ das2_ascii -h 
  
and see if it produces any help text.


8. Updating your path (optional)
================================
If you set PREFIX to "/usr/local" and N_ARCH to "/", close the Terminal,
you're done!  

If not, you will need to edit your .bashrc file by adding a line similar
to the one below:

  PATH=${PATH}:PREFIX/bin/N_ARCH
  
in order to put the das2 stream programs on your path.

Here PREFIX and N_ARCH should be replaced with the *actual values* you set in
the environment variables in step 3.  You can't use the environment varibles
directly as they will disappear when the Terminal app is closed.

Since GCC automatically looks in /usr/include and /usr/lib, but libdas2 wasn't
installed in that location you will need to add the following during build
steps for software that uses libdas2:

    -I PREFIX/include/N_ARCH   (substitute actual values for PREFIX and N_ARCH)
    
to compiler command line and:

    -L PREFIX/lib/N_ARCH       (substitute actual values for PREFIX and N_ARCH)
    
to linker command line.


9. Get rid of the annoying DFT function message (optional)
==========================================================
The das2 power spectral density calculator program (das2_psd) uses the FFTW
(Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) library.  The time to calculate
various transforms can be improved considerably by letting the transform
planner measure the speed of various operations on your particular computer
hardware and saving the results.

When libdas2 loads, it looks for the file /etc/fftw/wisdom.  If it's present
the file is loaded and the contents passed to the fftw libraries.  To generate
a wisdom file issue the commands:

   $ fftw-wisdom -v -t 1 -c -o wisdom
   $ sudo mkdir /etc/fftw
   $ sudo cp wisdom /etc/fftw

WARNING:  The fftw-wisdom command takes one hour to run and generates a good
bit of diagnostic output to the screen, so run it in a terminal you're not
using for other activities.


10. Installing language bindings, such as das2py
===============================================
Each extension has it's own install instructions for example run:
 
 $ cd bindings/python
 $ gedit INSTALL.txt

to view instructions for building the python extension modules.
