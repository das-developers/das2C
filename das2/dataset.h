/* Old initial comment that kicked off the entire das2 data model design...
 *
 * The structures below are the start of an idea on how to get independent
 * parameters for data at any particular index.  These are just thoughts
 * at the moment and don't affect any working code.  There are many ways
 * to do this.  The CDF and QStream assumption is that there are the same
 * number of parameters locating a data point in parameter space as there
 * are indices to the dataset.  Because of this x,y,z scatter data are 
 * hard to handle.
 *  
 * For x,y,z scatter lists there is 1 index for any point in the dataset, 
 * but for each index there are 2 independent parameters.  Basically QStream
 * and CDF assume that all datasets are CUBEs in parameter space but this
 * is not the case for a great many sets. 
 *
 * To adequately handle these 'path' datasets a parameter map is required.
 * The mapping takes 1 index value per data rank and returns 1 to N parameter
 * values.
 *
 * These structures start to handle this idea but are just doodles at this
 * point. -cwp 2017-07-25

/* Second comment that added desire for flexible data types ...
 * 
 * Thinking about coordinate returns, how about a data set of thefts / month
 * in 5 cities...  Won't usually come up, but should be possible
 * to handle.  Here's the data set:
 *
 *              2016-01 2016-02 2016-03 2016-04 2016-05 2016-06

 * BogotaÃƒ       109065  110365   99625   98265   43850   33892
 * Chicago         4789    5764    8901   10145   13456   22678
 * Des Moines         4      10      33      35      44     107
 *
 * Properties:  Title -> "Thefts/Month for selected cities"
 *
 * Okay, the X axis data type is text[12] (need null char)
 *           Y axis data type is datetime
 *           Z axis data type is datum, "thefts month**-1"
 *
 * So what is the return value from pDs->bin(pDs, 0, 0) ?
 *
 * The bin is defined on the space of all UTC times, and on the space of all
 * cities in the data set.
 *
 *
 * So, what about this common data set, interference events:
 *
 * |<----------     Bin      ------>|  |<----- Value --->|
 * 2016-01-01T14:00  2016-01-02T02:20  Mag Roll

/** Das Datasets
 *
 * Das Datasets provide storage for arrays that contains both data values and
 * coordinate values.  Each dataset corresponds to a single index space.
 * All variables in the dataset support the same bulk index range, though they
 * may not produce unique values for each distinct set of indices.
 *  
 * Mapping from the dataset index space to individual arrays is handled by
 * variables (::DasVar).
 *
 * Variables are grouped together into *physical* dimension by das2 
 * dimension (::DasDim) objects.  Each variable in a dimension servers a 
 * role.  For example providing center point values.  Bin max values, bin
 * min, uncertianty, etc.
 * 
 * A typical dataset consisting of a Time dimension, Frequency dimension and 
 * Amplitude dimension may have the following index ranges:
 * 
 * @code
     Time(i:0..152, j:-    )   // Defined in 1st index, any 2nd index is okay
     Freq(i:-,      j:0..1440) // Defined in 2nd index, any 1st index is okay
     Amp( i:0..152, j:0..1440) // Defined in both indices
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Here <b>i</b> is the first index and <b>j</b> is the second.
 *
 * The first two dimensions define a time and frequency coordinates space, and 
 * the last provides amplitude values collected at over time and frequency.
 * 
 * @todo explain variables in dimensions and point-spreads
 * 
 * Binning these values could proceed in a loops such as described in the 
 * the ::DasDs_lengthLast function.
