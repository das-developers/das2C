libdas2 - Core das2 client libraries

  Version 2.3 Build/Install instructions
  
These are general purpose instructions explaining what must be done but not
exactly how.  If you are viewing these instructions separate from the source
code, skip down to the "Getting the Software" section below to get the code.

Specific build/install proceedures for your operating system (or one close to
it) may be found in the doc/ subdirectory:

   doc/install_fedora.txt        (Linux, works for CentOS and RedHat as well)
   doc/install_neon.txt          (Linux, works Ubuntu based distributions)
   doc/install_visual_studio.txt (Windows, using Visual Studio Tools)
   doc/install_mac_10.12.txt     (MacOS)

If none of these work or you want a more general procedure continue reading
below.  To install the python extension, das2py, look in the:

    bindings/python/INSTALL.txt
    
file in the source directory.  das2py depends on libdas2 so you'll need to
build it first.


Prerequisite packages
=====================
libdas2.3 depends on the following external libraries.

  * Expat     Extended Markup Language (XML) parsing
              https://libexpat.github.io/
              
  * FFTW3     Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (Version 3)
              http://www.fftw.org/
  
  * OpenSSL   cryptographic algorithms and protocols
              https://www.openssl.org/
              
  * zlib      compression and decompression
              https://www.zlib.net/
  
  * pthreads  Multi-thread sycronization library
              Part of system libraries on Linux, Mac OS and Android.  Windows
              port is here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/

You'll need to install C header files for each of these and, potentially,
adjust the build steps to find them.  This is typically easier than it
sounds as some of the packages are already supplied with the base operating
system.


Getting the Software
====================
To download the software, get the newest version from our version control
server at Iowa using the command:

  $ svn export https://saturn.physics.uiowa.edu/svn/das2/core/stable/libdas2_3
  
  
  
Building the Software
=====================
You will need the following programs to build the software:

  * A C compiler, either gcc or cl.exe
  * A make program, either GNU make or Microsoft nmake
  * A shell, either bash or cmd.exe

Set an environment variable specifing where the software will be installed

  $ export PREFIX=/your/root/location
  -or-
  > set PREFIX=C:\Your\Install\Location
  
If you are keeping binaries separated by operating system in a shared disk
enviroment (not common), Set an environment variable specifing what
hardware-specific directory name you would like to use:

  $ export N_ARCH=centos7  (or mint18, android4, mac_10_12, or what have you)
  -or-
  > set N_ARCH=win10
  
If not use a single slash to indicate no hardware specific subdirectory

  $ export N_ARCH=/
  -or-
  > set N_ARCH=\
    
Run the build command for the C library

  $ make
  -or-
  > nmake /f makefiles/Windows.mak
  
Run the test command for the C library

  $ make test
  -or-
  > nmake /f makefiles/Windows.mak run_test
    
To install the software run:

  $ make install
  --or--
  > nmake /f makefiles/Windows.mak install
  

If any of the steps break, contact the current maintainer of libdas2.  As of
2019-05-05 this is Chris Piker at the University of Iowa.


Manifest
========
After installing the software you should have the following files, where 
PREFIX is the name of the root directory where you selected to install the
software, and N_ARCH is the optional OS specific directory.


* In PREFIX/bin/N_ARCH/ 

   das1_ascii       das1_bin_avg           das1_fxtime
   das1_inctime     das2_ascii             das2_bin_avg
   das2_bin_avgsec  das2_bin_peakavgsec    das2_bin_ratesec
   das2_from_das1   das2_from_tagged_das1  das2_hapi
   das2_histo       das2_prtime            das2_psd
   
   (15 files, on Windows these will end in .exe)


* In PREFIX/lib/N_ARCH/
   
   libdas2.3.a    libdas2.3.so            (Linux, MacOS)
