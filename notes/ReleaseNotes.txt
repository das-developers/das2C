libdas2 - version 2.3

This library and it's associated utility programs are intended for reading,
processing and writing Das2 Streams in C, D and Python.  It provides no support
for data display as that is handled by the entensive Java dasCore library,
Autoplot and your own code if desired.

Changes from libdas2 1.1 to 1.2  (2018-02-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Many enhancements for consuming das2 streams.  Though libdas2 is not
   graphic client (nor will it ever be) it can be used to read streams into
   memory arrays.  The new modules: 
   
      array.c, builder.c, cordata.c
      
   provide the new functionality.  Examples of reading local and remote streams
   may be found in test/TestArray.c and test/TestBuilder.c

2. Libdas2 can now read from remote http servers.  The new modules:

      credmngr.c and http.c

   Provide this functionality.  In addition io.c (formerly dasIO.c) has been
   updated so that I/O read objects can created for remote servers.  

3. libdas2 bindings for D have been enhanced.

4. libdas2 now builds on MacOS X. As long as FFTW3 libraries are present.  At
   the time of this writing the  easiest way to install it is to use the
   Homebrew package manager:

       brew install fftw


Changes from libdas2 1.1 versus libdas2 1.0
-------------------------------------------
1. The Units class (UnitType) has been heavily updated to handle general SI
   unit parsing and conversion.  In the author's opinion this is the most
	general unit processing library short of using UDUNITS from unidata.  See 
	test/TestArray.c for usage examples.

2. Support for storing stream data into continuous arrays has been added.  
   Three classes, CorData (Correlated Datasets), DasAry (Multi-dimensional 
	Array arbitrarily ragged arrays), and Builder (build CorData structures
	from Das2 Sreams) provide support.  See the test/TestBuilder.c for useage
	examples.
	
3. Stream download over HTTP has been added and the DasIO class has been
   updated to read over a network socket.

4. Power preserving descrete Fourier transform support has been added, see
   dft.c and dft.h and additions to pywrap.c

5. A incomplete D lanugage interface module has been started, comprised of the
   files  das2/package.d, das2/dwrap.d, daspkt.d

Libdas2 - A re-work of Das2StreamUtils

This library and it's associated utility programs are intended for reading,
processing and writing Das2 Streams.  It provides no support for data display
as that is handled by the entensive Java dasCore library and Autoplot.
Libdas2 and it's utilities are a re-work of Jeremy's Das2StreamUtilities.


Changes from libdas2 1.0 verses Das2StreamUtils
-----------------------------------------------

1. Much more attention is paid to memory usage.  This work-alike library
   should not leak memory.
   
2. Full Doxygen documentation has been added for all library functions.
   Documentation was written in Javadoc style for compatibility with the
   Netbeans IDE.

3. Utility programs have full manpage text.

4. Utility programs always return non-zero value to the shell on an 
   error to better interoperate with the Das2 server.
   
5. Assumptions in the utility programs that packets contain only one <y>
   or <yscan> plane per packet have been removed.
   
6. timeXX and asciiXX data value encodings are now variable width instead
   of a fixed enumeration of sizes.

7. Error handling improved.  Library no longer calls abort() unless the
   end user wants it to, option to return on error instead of calling
   exit() added, error messages improved to provide specific file and
   line numbers for debugging.

8. <z> planes now allowed in packets, library checks for presence
   of corresponding <y> plane.
   
9. Encoding class introduced which allows for overridding I/O ASCII 
   encodings.  Yscan items can also have a custom ASCII encoding.

10. Buffer class introduced to cut down on internal memory copies.
   
11. Callback processing improved.  User data pointers added to allow for
   stateful processing.  Both input and output operations can have
   processing hooks, 1-n callback sets allowed for input or output to
   allow for more modular processing.

12. Das2 Stream property handling updated.  Uses Standard property names
   from the Das 2.2 ICD, but is backwards compatable.  All standard
   property types are handled (boolean, int, double, String, Datum, and
   DatumRange)

13. C99 compliance.  GCC specific extensions have been replaced.

14. New library uses more standard C syntax.  'const' is used to indicate
    items which will not be mutated, array counters are of type size_t 
    and pointers are visible as pointers and not hidden via typedefs.  All
    globals and static variables have been removed to allow for lib use in
    multi-threaded applications.


Using das2 C-lib versus das2StreamUtil
--------------------------------------
Linking:
    Replace -lDas2Stream with -ldas2

Compiling:
    Replace "#include <Das2Stream.h>" with "#include <das2/core.h>"

Scripting:
    Program names have been changed so that they my exist in the filesystem
    next to existing versions.  Corresponding names are given below:
    
    Das2StreamUtils        LibDas2

    binAverage             das2_bin_avg
    binAverageSeconds      das2_bin_avgsec
    das1ToDas2             das2_from_das1
    deflateStream          das2_deflate
    inflateStream          das2_inflate
    peakAverageSeconds     das2_bin_peakavgsec
